# Other regularization methods

1. Data Augmentation
    Can be use as regularization technique.
    Don't add much value.

2. Early stopping

    Plot the train set error on J
    Plot the dev set error
    Purpose:
        - It means stopping your training process early.
        - by stopping mid-size our w size will not so big.
        - It's similar to L2 regularization by taking.
    Downside:
        -

3. Gradient Checking

    Implementation notes:

        - Don't use in training - only to debug
